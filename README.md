Android application to explore movies 

#Description

Application that allows users to login, explore popular movies, and to save movies to favourite lists.

I created this app as a way to search for movies rated as below 50% for a group of friends that only watches "bad" movies once a week.

This app currently searches for movies, and is buggy, but still very much working to correct the bugs and add more features to get the ideal Android application.

#Built using
Firebase authentication and Realtime Database to save user data
The Movies Database API to get movies/tv-shows data

#Libraries used
Retrofit – the HTTP Client for Android
Gson – java serialization library to convert objects to JSON and back
Glide – image loading and caching library for Android

#Pre-requisites
Android SDK, Android Studio/Eclipse IDE/etc

Minimal SDK version: 21
